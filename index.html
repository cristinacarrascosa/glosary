                                                        UDP protocol such as SCTP, an Internet protocol that is located
                                                        in the transport layer of the OSI model. The purpose of the TCP
                                                        protocol is to create connections within a data network made up
                                                        of computer networks to exchange data. In addition, in terms of
                                                        its operation, it guarantees that the data will be delivered to
                                                        its destination without errors and in the same order in which it
                                                        was transmitted2. It also provides a mechanism to distinguish
                                                        different applications within the same machine, through the port

                                                        In the TCP/IP protocol stack, TCP is the middle layer between
                                                        the network protocol (IP) and the application. Applications
                                                        often require reliable communication over the network. For this,
                                                        the TCP protocol is implemented, which ensures that the data
                                                        issued by the client are received by the server without errors
                                                        and in the same order that they were issued, despite working
                                                        with the services of the IP layer, which is not reliable. It is
                                                        a connection-oriented protocol, since the client and the server
                                                        must announce each other and accept the connection before
                                                        starting to transmit the data to that user who must receive

                                                        (browsers, file sharing, FTP clients, etc.) and HTTP, SMTP, SSH,

                                                        address serves two main functions: network interface

                                                        identifies the host, or more specifically its network interface,

                                                        thus the capability of establishing a path to that host. Its
                                                        role has been characterized as follows: "A name indicates what

                                                        to get there."[2] The header of each IP packet contains the IP
                                                        address of the sending host and that of the destination host.

                                                        this number, some addresses are reserved for special purposes
                                                        such as private networks (~18 million addresses) and multicast
                                                        addressing (~270 million addresses).

                                                        IPv4 addresses are usually represented in dot-decimal notation,

                                                        separated by dots, e.g., 192.0.2.1. Each part represents a group
                                                        of 8 bits (an octet) of the address.[8] In some cases of

                                                        for the foreseeable future.

                                                        specification lays out functional and non-functional
                                                        requirements, and it may include a set of use cases that
                                                        describe user interactions that the software must provide to the

                                                        development.[3] To derive the requirements, the developer needs
                                                        to have clear and thorough understanding of the products under

                                                    <b>Mock:</b><br> Mock tests are unit tests that use
                                                    simulated ("mock") objects that replace real objects
                                                    used by the class or code snippet to test. For example,
                                                    if you have one
                                                    Calculator class that needs a DAO (Data Access Object)
                                                    to get information from the database, this DAO is what
                                                    we call the “real object”. If we wanted to test the
                                                    Calculator class,
                                                    we should pass the object a valid connection to the database
                                                    and make sure the data you need exists. This process of
                                                    determine the data the object needs and insert it into the database
                                                    requires
                                                    of a lot of work. Instead, you can provide an instance
                                                    fake DAO that only returns what we need for the test.
                                                    This class will not take the information from the database, but
                                                    what's it gonna be
                                                    a mockup Replacing the actual object makes testing the class
                                                    Calculator much simpler. Strictly speaking, said
                                                    object that replaces the real DAO would not be a mock, but a stub.
                                                    We'll talk about this later
                                                    difference. This punctual example of the Calculator class can be
                                                    generalize by saying that it is a unit (Calculator) using a
                                                    collaborator (DAO).

                                                        Integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a
                                                        system or component with specified functional requirements.[1]
                                                        It occurs after unit testing and before system testing.
                                                        Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been
                                                        unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests
                                                        defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates, and
                                                        delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system

                                                        There are two main types of code repository platforms –
                                                        centralized version control systems (VCS) and distributed
                                                        version control systems (DVCS). The former is an older kind,
                                                        where there is only one central code repository, and you, as a
                                                        developer, can contribute only to that repository. If you don’t
                                                        have access to the Internet and the code is located on an
                                                        external server, bad luck – you can’t commit your changes. An
                                                        example of such a system is Subversion (aka SVN) and CSV.
                                                        <br>
                                                        Thankfully, there are distributed VCS, which support several
                                                        repositories for the project. This way, each developer can have
                                                        her/his own local repository (one or several), and work
                                                        autonomously with each one. Such DVCS allows you to work even in
                                                        conditions where you don’t have an Internet connection (for
                                                        example, somewhere on a beach in Thailand.)

                                                            normally consists of at least a source code editor, build

                                                            and Eclipse, contain the necessary compiler, interpreter, or

                                                            essentially provides the language and contract for how two
                                                            systems interact. Each API has documentation and
                                                            specifications which determine how information can be

                                                            communication channel. When an API interacts with another

                                                            endpoints. For APIs, an endpoint can include a URL of a
                                                            server or service. Each endpoint is the location from which

        The NOT NULL constraint prevents a column from having a NULL value.
        When no value is defined for a column, the DEFAULT Constraint provides a default value.
        A UNIQUE Constraint ensures that any value in a column is unique.
        Each row/record in a database table is uniquely identified by the PRIMARY Key.
        A FOREIGN KEY recognizes a row/record in any database table uniquely.

                                                            Essentially, a promise is a return object to which
                                                            attach callback functions, instead of passing callbacks to a

                                                            Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented

                                                            the provided abstraction without understanding or even

                                                            That’s a very generic concept that’s not limited to

                                                            programming paradigm that starts from the concept of

                                                            properties) and code in the form of methods.

                                                            Objects are capable of interacting and modifying the values
                                                            contained in their fields or attributes (state) through

                                                            libraries.

                                                            Encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object. This facilitates code refactoring, for example allowing the author of the class to change how objects of that class represent their data internally without changing any external code (as long as "public" method calls work the same way). It also encourages programmers to put all the code that is concerned with a certain set of data in the same class, which organizes it for easy comprehension by other programmers. Encapsulation is a technique that encourages decoupling.

                                                            Object-oriented programming is an approach to designing modular reusable software systems. The object-oriented approach is an evolution of good design practices that go back to the very beginning of computer programming. Object-orientation is simply the logical extension of older techniques such as structured programming and abstract data types. An object is an abstract data type with the addition of polymorphism and inheritance.

                                                            developed to help define and share applications
                                                            of
                                                            various containers. With Compose, you can create a file
                                                            YAML

                                                            and, with a single command, get it all up and running or kill it.
